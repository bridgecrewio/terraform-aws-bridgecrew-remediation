Terraform module - for Bridgecrew Remediations

---

It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).

## Usage

Include **module.remediation.tf** this repository as a module in your existing Terraform code:

```terraform
module "remediation" {
  source      = "bridgecrewio/bridgecrew-remediation/aws"
  api-token   = var.apitoken
  version     = "v0.1.1"
}
